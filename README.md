## Does this work on iPhones, iPads, Windows Phones, Firefox, or something you haven't mentioned here?

No.


## Tracking/Security

This extension saves information to your browser locally if you choose such as options/preferences you set, chat that you save, and browser version which you can export out to yourself via CSV file and is deleted when you uninstall the extension. We save none of your options/preferences "in the cloud" at this time.  We currently use no tracking or advertising or cookies at this time of 4/2023. This may change and you will be notified if it does. We are currently a very small team and do not have time or resources for large privacy policy scope or legal/public relations/social/customer service policy other than to provide the basic technical features needed to the streamers for their usage.
